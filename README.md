Steam Web API library
========

#### Description ####

This is a .NET library that makes it easy to use the Steam Web API. It conveniently wraps around all of the JSON data and ugly API details with clean methods, structures and classes.

#### Reference ####

The previous versions of this API are obsolete (in this fork), so the documentation no longer applies. Updates to this guide will be added soon.
